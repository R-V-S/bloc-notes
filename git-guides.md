I think the most helpful git command to remember is:

```
git help -g
```

It lists git's built-in guides, which you can run by typing git help name-of-guide, e.g.

```
git help everyday (really useful)
```

or

```
git help tutorial (also really useful)
```

You can basically use those as cheat sheets until you memorize the basic git commands.
