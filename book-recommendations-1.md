* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://amzn.to/2fTO4vu) - A seminal book on software architecture, though it's old now. You can read the intro for free, which might help you decide whether it's worth buying.
* [JavaScript Patterns](http://amzn.to/2fPmOn0) - Inspired by the book above, it features less patterns, but they're more relevant than they used to be.
* [Refactoring](http://amzn.to/2fTPuXd) - It's about refactoring code, but it's very relevant to writing code: If you know how to refactor code, you won't have to write code that needs to be refactored.
* [Clean Code](http://amzn.to/2gIYXCb) - A good read that's full of best practices. Strongly recommend, though it's a little pricey for what it is (a pretty easy read, not that comprehensive).
