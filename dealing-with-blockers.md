#How to deal with blockers

There are always going to be blockers in the world of tech, and they're not always bugs. Maybe it's some script being run on a database, an upgrade, a download, an install, etc... and, of course, there's the dependency on other people. 

Having a few different things to do at any given moment is pretty important to a coder's sanity. It can also be a good opportunity to take a short break and grab a coffee/tea/soda/water (getting up and walking around at least once an hour is a good habit to develop, too). But if you want to stay focused on education, there are a few go-to sites that I recommend:

[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) - Nice, light reading for front-end devs and designers.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - The free courses are a great resource for beginners, and even pros who want to brush up on something.

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - They have computing courses and a pretty good app... I like their Computer Science course.

[w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) - Old, but still a decent way to pick up on the basics.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) - Tons of content, if you like video learning.

[Enki](https://www.enki.com/) - 5-minute daily workouts for developers.

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) - OK, you're probably not quite ready for this, but it's a great way to build your skills and kill time once you have a solid foothold on basic coding.

[YouTube](http://youtube.com/) - There's so much educational content on YouTube it's unbelievable. The quality ranges from dangerously terrible (so just be careful) to incredibly good. And, of course, there's TED talks, talking cats, screaming goats, etc.
