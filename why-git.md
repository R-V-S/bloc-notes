This is why we use git:

* When used with a service like GitHub, it saves your project in the cloud.
* It saves snapshots of your project so that you can always go back to a previous point in your project development. It's like Time Machine for your project. Or like an "Undo/redo" stack that never forgets anything.
* It makes it easy for a team of developers to work on one project at the same time without stepping on eachother's toes. This is the real strength of git, and why it's used on virtually every coding project these days.
