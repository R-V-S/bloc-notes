# Learning Strategies

## Staying healthy

* Take a short break to get up and walk around at least once an hour
* Find a nice environment to be in while you learn
* Use a comfortable chair
* Find a posture that’s healthy but maintainable
* Standing desk
* Keep your arms, wrists, hands and fingers relaxed as you work


## Setting the right pace

* Learning to code poorly can be a sprint, but learning to code well is a marathon
* Coding well isn’t about learning a programming language or a set of syntaxes: It’s about thinking intelligently

## Methods

### Use Background knowledge

Try and relate what you’re learning to topics you’re already familiar with

### Personalize

Link new material to your personal experiences (hobbies, interests?)

### Summarize
Write or speak aloud a summary of what you’ve just learned

### Use Imagery

Associate new information with a mental or printed image to help you learn it

### Apply Metacognitive Learning

Actively analyzing how you learn best.

Ask yourself these questions:  

0. What do I do before I start? *(Planning)*  
0. What do I do while I am working on the task? *(Managing)*  
1. How do I make sure I am doing the task correctly? *(Monitoring)*  
1. What do I do after I have finished the task ? *(Evaluating)*  

**Memorization vs Comprehension**: There’s a complex relationship between the two because so many concepts are dependent on other concepts. Sometimes memorization necessarily comes before comprehension, and vice versus. Focus on comprehension first, if possible. Fall back on memorization next, because comprehension will come as you absorb more data.

### A few other learning strategies:
* **Use clues** to make inferences/best guesses. Try and derive answers from context.
* **Make predictions**: Try to anticipate what’s coming next.
* **Use selective attention**: Focus on specific information, structures, key words, phrases, or ideas.
* **Cooperate**: Chat with others in the Slack channel.
* **Access Information Sources**: Find alternative reference materials.
* Talk Yourself Through It (**self talk**): Use your inner resources. Reduce your anxiety by reminding yourself of your progress, the resources you have available, and your goals.
* Reach out to your mentor (or others at Bloc - we’re your support group).
* Memorization strategies:
	* Create your own cheat-sheets
	* Repetition and muscle memory
	* Fill up a [memory palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)
	* Create imaginative mental Images
