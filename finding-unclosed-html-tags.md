You could use a tool like [this one](http://jona.ca/blog/unclosed-tag-finder), but it might be good for you to scan the HTML and try to find the unclosed tag yourself. Try this:

- Have a piece of paper and a pen/pencil ready
- Go through the HTML line by line
- When you see an opening tag, jot its name down on the paper
- When you see a closing tag, cross that tag name out. If you have a missing opening tag, there won't be an uncrossed tag for you to cross out.
- If you have any missing closing tags, then they'll be left uncrossed by the time you reach the end of the document.
