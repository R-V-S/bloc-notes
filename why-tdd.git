TDD a lot of work, but it's worth it. Consider this: 

The bigger your project grows, the harder it is to manually test every little variable. 

If you decide to refactor a feature, you're going to break things. 

If you're human, you're going to miss something.

If you miss something and you have tests written that check _everything_, you might be saved the embarrassment of letting a user find your bug for you.
