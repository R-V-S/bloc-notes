Macs became really popular among developers for one big reason: The terminal. The MacOS actually runs largely on a Unix-like platform called [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD), and the mac's terminal is basically the FreeBSD engine that runs under the hood.

This is helpful for developers because servers typically run on Unix-like platforms, too (usually Linux). If our dev environment can work like our server environment, that makes it easier to develop and deploy our work.

Windows has always had the "command prompt" but it's always been a handicapped version of MS-DOS, which isn't used on servers. **BUT** Windows 10 has a new type of terminal now. It's called the [bash shell](http://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10) and it lets you run linux commands . It's pretty new, but it's a big step forward for Windows web developers. Previously, installing things like Ruby was really hard to do on a Windows machine.

Also, with more and more online dev environments like [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/) out there, it's becoming less important to do everything on your own computer.

The latest macs went up in price, too. Some devs are looking at Windows machines because of the cost difference, just like you. So things are changing.

Also, even though macs are extremely popular among developers, plenty of devs that are gamers run Windows at home. You don't have to be an Apple fanboy to be a dev. All that matters is that you can say in a job interview that you're familiar with MacOS, if that's what the company uses. 

Touchscreens are awesome, too, and macs just don't have those.

All that being said, I should probably mention that I ordered one of the new macs...... I looked at Windows and Linux machines, and I know I could have gotten a machine with the same specs for a lot less... but I wanted the high-brightness screen (so I can do sessions outside in the warmer seasons), the super fast HD, the giant trackpad, the fast/shallow keyboard, and the (possibly gimmicky) touchbar. But that was my personal decision. Can't say I'd recommend a mac over a Windows machine for everyone.

My 2c: Order the machine that fits your needs and your budget. Buy the machine, not the operating system. Might even want to look at Linux machines. [System76](https://system76.com/) makes good ones. And look at refurbished machines, too. Apple sells refurbished. [Woot](http://www.woot.com/) is always selling refurbished computers. Check out [FatWallet](https://www.fatwallet.com/) for deals. 

And, most important of all â€“ **try it before you buy it**. Pay extra attention to how the keyboard feels (and trackpad, if you use it). The last thing you want is for the keyboard to give you hand/wrist issues, because you'll be using it **a lot**.
