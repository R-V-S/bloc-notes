How to share Code Wars solutions:

1. Go to the solutions page for your account at this URL (replacing {username} with your own):

  ```
https://www.codewars.com/users/{username}/completed_solutions
```

2. Find the solution you want to share. 

3. Click on the "discuss" link below the solution. Note that not all solutions on the page will have the "discuss" link. Only "final" submissions will have it.

3. Copy and paste that URL. It should begin with `https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/` and then be followed by gibberish.
