How to share Code Wars solutions:

1. Go to the solutions page for your account at this URL (replacing {username} with your own):

  ```
https://www.codewars.com/users/{username}/completed_solutions
```

2. Find the solution you want to share and click on the "discuss" link below the solution. Note that all successful solutions appear on the page, whether they were "final" submissions or not â€“ the "discuss" link will only appear for final solutions.

3. Copy and paste that URL. It should begin with `https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/` and then be followed by gibberish.
