# Why Learn JavaScript Before Ruby

0. As the only natively supported scripting language that major browsers support, JS is unquestionably useful. This is important beacuase beginners tend to ask, "Why do I need to learn this? Do I _really_ need to learn this?". Ruby is wonderful and elegant, but it's niche language that many graduates (esp. front-end) won't use everyday, while JS is (for better or for worse) ubiquitous. 

0. It's easier to demonstrate how everything on the web ties together with JS + HTML + CSS. Many students – especially the visual learners that will be drawn to front-end development – will really struggle with learning abstract concepts. With JS, we can very quickly demonstrate how code can have an impact on how something looks and interacts.

0. Students getting hired while they're still in the program is a great problem to have. This is more likely to happen with front-end devs that have a strong grasp of HTML, CSS, and JS.

0. Prototypical inheritance, hoisting, and asynchronous code are extremely useful concepts to absorb. I feel like the process of learning those concepts (whatever you think of them in practice) make my students better programmers.

0. Ruby has some shortcomings as an educational language: It's vocabulary is much bigger, and like Javascript, it has concepts that are quirky and difficult for beginners to internalize: yields, procs vs lambdas, strange logical operator differences (`and` vs `||`), built-in globals (`$?`, `$'`, `$1`, `$$`, etc.)
