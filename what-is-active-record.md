Active Record, it is:

* A library – just a collection of Ruby files and methods.
* A gem – the library is stored in a gem for easy installation.
* A core part of Rails – the gem is bundled into the `rails` gem.
* An ORM – an Object Relational Mapper. That means it's the middle-man between your app and the database. You define models in Rails. Models are classes that are used to instantiate objects. Active Record maps those objects to a relational database. Objects mapped to relational database = Object Relational Mapping.
